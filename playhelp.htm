<h3>Play</h3>
<p>
Play a game of chess against Lozza. By default you will be playing with the
white pieces. Use the Play menu to change colour and start or restart a new game
with with the black or white pieces.
<p>
You can change how well Lozza plays at any time - including during a game - by using
the Strength menu.  If you find you are making mistakes, try using a
lower strength.  Lozza will make her own mistakes at levels 1 to 8; the higher the level
the fewer the mistakes. Level 1 is suitable for somebody that has learned the rules and
looking to play some first games. Level 10 is suitable for strong club players.
<p>
While Lozza is thinking some information is shown above the board and after Lozza
has moved the information will look something like this:-
<p><b>1 s | 948.29 kn | 947.34 kn/s | 0.1%</b>
<p><b>1 s</b> is the time lozza took to move. <b>948.29 kn</b> can be thought of as
the total number of moves Lozza analysed while making her move. <b>947.34 kn/s</b> is the number of moves
analysed per second. <b>0.1%</b> is the percentage of her internal memory used so far.

<p>
The Analyse button will open a new web page allowing you to analyse the current position.
Both web pages will be active. It's easier to bounce between play and analyse pages using a
laptop rather than a phone.

<h3>Optional URL parameters</h3>

<p><b>c=b</b>
<p>You play black. Default is you play white.

<p><b>l=<i>1 to 10</i></b>
<p>Sets the initial strength.  Default is level 1 (<i>l=1</i>)

<p><b>fen=<i>fen</i></b>
<p>Use the specified FEN string to start the game from. The default is the standard start position.

<p><b>m=<i>ucigocommand</i></b>
<p>Lozza uses the UCI go command to make her move rather than the fixed time. For example to ask Lozza
to search to a depth of 2 ply only use:-
<p>https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/play.htm?m=go depth 2
<p>Another example, to ask Lozza to make her move after searching 100000 nodes, use:-
<p>https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/play.htm?m=go nodes 100000
<p>This can also be used to play with a fixed move time of less than 1 second, for example to make Lozza move after 200ms use:-
<p>https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui/play.htm?m=go movetime 200
