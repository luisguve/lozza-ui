## Lozza User Interfaces

This is a sister project to my Javascript chess engine Lozza - https://github.com/op12no2/lozza - providing example web interfaces. 

You can try them here - https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui

They are designed to be mobile-friendly.  There is no app for the user interfaces but you can add screen link so that they are one click away. 

There are various strengths you can choose when playing Lozza.  If you have just learned the rules, try level 1 and work your way up when you win consistently. At levals 1 to 4, Lozza will make mistakes that you can take advantage of. 

The mate-in-one game sounds easy, but it's often hard to see the mate quickly.
